        I was originally born in a small village in Yorkshire, England. In the
        late 1980s, I left England to begin a career in finance in Jersey,
        Channel Islands. I moved to my current home in Galway, Ireland in 2005,
        where I took a parental break to raise my two children.
      </p>
      <p className="profile-paragraph">
        While taking a parental break, I studied the field of software
        development, where my enthusiasm to gain knowledge took me on a long and
        exciting journey. In 2021, I joined the Oracle Digital Experience Team
        in Dublin as a React Frontend Developer.

      <p className="profile-paragraph">
        As a Frontend Developer working in an agile team environment, I am
        responsible for building and refactoring React components. Each
        component is unit tested using the Jest Library and has a coresponding
        storybook component which provides an extensive visual library for the
        end user. Working from home, I am lucky to be able to connect and engage
        with a team worldwide. This has provided a warm cultural and team
        comradery that makes my job such a joy.
      </p>
      <p className="profile-paragraph">
        Through continuous development over the years, I have gained knowledge
        in many areas, including languages such as Java and Python. I have
        developed with frameworks such as React, Angular, Flask, and Django and
        have added backend solutions with Node.js and Python. I have worked with
        both MySQL and NoSQL databases, gaining qualification as an Oracle MySQL
        Administrator. With cloud computing, I have gained an Oracle Cloud
        Infrastructure qualification as well as having experienced cloud
        computing with AWS. My curiosity for continual growth keeps me going
        with a passion for what I do.
