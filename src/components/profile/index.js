        I am from a small village in Yorkshire, England. I left
        England to begin a career in Finance in Jersey, Channel Islands and
        finally moved to my current home in Galway, Ireland in 2005, where I
        took a parental break to raise my two children.
      </p>
      <p className="profile-paragraph">
        Whilst taking a parental break, I studied the field of Software
        Development, where my enthusiasm to gain knowledge took me on a long and
        exciting journey. In 2021, I joined the Oracle Digital Experience Team
        in Dublin as a React Frontend Developer.  Since then I have gained further experience working for Fidelity International in Dublin working with React for the website and React Native for both IOS and Android mobile devices.

        As a Frontend Developer working in an agile team environment, I am
        responsible for building and refactoring React components. Each
        component is unit tested using the Jest library and correlates to a
        matching storybook component to provide an extensive visual library for
        the end user. Working from home, I am lucky to be able to connect and
        engage with a team worldwide. This has provided a warm cultural and team
        comradery that makes my job such a joy.

        Through continuous learning over the years, I have gained knowledge in many areas, including languages such as Java and Python. I have developed with libraries / frameworks such as React, React Native, Angular, Flask, and Django and have added backend solutions with Node.js and Python. I have worked with both relational and non-relational databases, gaining qualification as an Oracle MySQL Administrator and Apollo GraphQl Professional. With cloud computing, I have gained an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure qualification as well as having experienced cloud computing with AWS. My curiosity for continual growth keeps me going with a passion for what I do.
