        I was originally born in Yorkshire, United Kingdom and relocated to
        Jersey Channel Islangs in the late 80's where I began a career in
        Finance. In 2005 I moved to my current home in Galway, Ireland where I
        took a parental break to raising my two children.
      </p>
      <p className="profile-paragraph">
        While taking a parental break I studied extensively the field of
        Software Development and after gaining many qualifications I returned to
        work in 2021 to work for Oracle in Dublin as a Member of the Technical
        Team.
