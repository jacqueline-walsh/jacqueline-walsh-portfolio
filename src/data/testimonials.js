    body: "I was delighted with the service provided by Jacqueline at Simply web Design. She put a lot of time finding out what I wanted (and helping me brainstorm when I wasn’t sure what I wanted!). She also kept me motivated with gentle encouragement whenever I started to procrastinate or suffer ‘writers block’. She had a lot of good ideas and a great eye for design, but was also very flexible and open to my requests and suggestions. The webpage has exceeded my expectations, and has had a lot of positive feedback from my friends and peers. I can highly recommend Simply Web Design- what you will end up with is a unique design, perfectly tailor made to get your message out there.",

    body: "I have to say, all credit to the lovely Jacqueline – Simply Web Design. I couldn’t possibly fault her hard work and dedication to perfection. As I had never dealt with a Web Designer before, I was a bit hesitant initially about what the finished product would look like. On our first meeting Jacqueline grasped exactly what I wanted and she certainly delivered. Thank you so much for your hard work, your professionalism and your lovely manner. I am thrilled with the results and will be recommending you to everyone.",
